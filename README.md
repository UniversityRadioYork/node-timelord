# node-timelord 

NodeJS implementation of Timelord



## How to run

See the [wiki](https://ury.org.uk/ceedox/computing:services:studioclock) for info about the deployment on URY.

### Development

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork/node-timelord/
$ cd node-timelord
$ npm install # you should only need to run this once
$ grunt
# browse to localhost:8000 to see it
# any changes to files in `src/` will be compiled and the browser will automatically reload 
```

### Production

Deployment on URY is handled by **Jenkins**. Use the `node-timelord` and `node-timelord-staging` jobs to deploy the master branch.
See the [wiki](https://ury.org.uk/ceedox/computing:services:studioclock#building_and_deployment_production) for more about deployment on URY.

#### Manual instructions

You will need some kind of way of serving static files from the `/bin` folder. I.E. Apache, Nginx etc.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork/node-timelord/
$ cd node-timelord
$ npm install # you should only need to run this once
$ grunt build #will compile all files needed into /bin/
```

If you want to do a development build without clearing out `/bin` then run `grunt build:noclean` instead.
